# Leave-Form-System
A Java project made by Arowa Yasmeen and Karishma Shaer to automize the Leave Form System for females in IUT.
There can be two types of accounts - Student and Authority.
Students can:
1. Request for leave
2. Request for leave extension
3. Confirm their arrival

Only the student end of the interface and back-end work has been done. The Authority side is yet to be implemented.
